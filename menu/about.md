**I am currently looking for a data science role based in Austin, TX, or a remote position.**

I am an Assistant Professor of Instruction for the [HDO Bachelor’s program](https://hdo.utexas.edu/ba/) and research consultant for the HDO Master’s program. I received my Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology from The University of Texas at Austin in 2019 under Dr. Art Markman. I graduated from Boston University in 2011 with a dual B.A. degree in Psychology and Neuroscience. I love statistics and data science, teaching people about different research methods, and how to apply this to real-world contexts. I am also passionate about making data-driven solutions and helping others make sense of their data. In my off time, I like to go bowling, play paintball and video games with my friends, and hang out with my dog Rocky Raccoon.
